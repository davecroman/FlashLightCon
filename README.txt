FlashLightCon is a simple in-game console for Flash-based applications.

I often run into situations where FlashDevelop is unable to connect to the debugger. This is usually because there's a problem with the debugger version or with the localhost itself. FlashLightCon is an alternative to those who keep experiencing Flash Debugger problems. It acts as a sprite-based console which you can use on your application to display output of the trace() method of Flex/AS3.
